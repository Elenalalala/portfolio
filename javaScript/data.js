Anyone can order their printed food at home.",

Data visualization is also a way of unveiling the meaning inside the data source. In a way, words and characters are a kind of data visualization and a kind of data source at the same time. I find this ambivalent duality very interesting. So I want to create my own duality by encoding and decoding the words in the book.",
